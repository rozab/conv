# Unit conversion cli script
I made this because I was fed up of typing `61" in cm` into google. It only does lengths right now, I plan on expanding functionality in the future. 

## Things to add
* support for mixed feet and inches e.g. `6'2"`, in both input and output
* support for more unit types
* smarter behaviour
