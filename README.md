# Unit conversion cli script
I made this because I was fed up of typing `61" in cm` into google. It only does time and length right now, I plan on expanding functionality in the future. 

## How to use
Just stick conv.py in usr/local/bin and `chmod +x conv.py`. 
You can rename it to whatever, no need to keep the extension. 

Start the shell by typing `conv.py` (or whatever you called it). Type `help` for help.
